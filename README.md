# Hola, soy Ale!

I’m Alexander Farrell (he/they), a Mexican-American Stage and Production Manager based in Pittsburgh and a current Master’s student in Arts Management at Carnegie Mellon University.  This portfolio was created as part of *Telling Stories with Data*, a course exploring how visual storytelling and data design can illuminate complex ideas and inspire informed action.

My background is rooted in theatre and live performance, where I specialize in creating collaborative environments that allow artists and teams to tell their stories with clarity and care.  As Technical Coordinator for CMU’s Playground Festival, I managed logistics for 48 independent productions, and as Production Manager for *Lorca in a Green Dress*, I helped lead the School of Drama’s first offsite production in years.

Most recently, as producer of [*Know Your Rights*](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOtwmdyD9fX/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==), I led the creation of a student-driven PSA aimed at empowering the Pittsburgh Latino community through creative and accessible legal education.  Produced by Nuestra Casa, an affinity group at the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama, and created in partnership with the local immigration support center Casa San José, the video fuses celebration with action—transforming vital immigration information into a vibrant, culturally resonant message of unity and strength. Beyond its creative storytelling, this project is a call to protect and uplift our communities, serving as both a public resource and an invitation to engage: with your neighbors, your rights, and the organizations doing the work every day.

### What I Hope to Learn
Through this course, I aim to deepen my understanding of how creative and analytical thinking can collaborate to shape meaningful narratives.  I’m interested in exploring how data can be used not just to inform, but to engage—and how visual storytelling can make complex information more accessible and emotionally resonant.  Specifically, I aim to learn how to utilize data-driven storytelling to promote equity in the arts, including revealing patterns, amplifying underrepresented voices, and fostering stronger, more transparent systems within cultural organizations.
