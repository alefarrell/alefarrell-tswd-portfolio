# Wireframes / Storyboards
Building on last week’s sketches, I used this week to refine the narrative arc, identify the key visual components of the project, and outline the high-fidelity visualizations needed to convey the story emerging from the data effectively.  With the text and overall flow now complete, I have compiled the visualization assets required for the final Shorthand piece.

Planned Visualizations
• Choropleth Map - Arts Access by State: Provides a national backdrop that situates Heinz within broader arts access trends.
• Line Graph - Arts Education Over Time: Illustrates changes in arts education offerings and participation nationwide, highlighting the extent to which Heinz is falling behind.
• Giorgia Lupi–Style Artistic Data Visualization: Maps arts and arts-adjacent courses at Heinz using an artistic, analog-data approach.  Data collection for this visualization is underway.
• Physical “Art of the Walls” Mock-Ups - Conceptual renderings of how art installations could physically enhance the Heinz College environment, demonstrating the potential impact of visual culture on the space.

A working draft of the Shorthand site is attached and reflects early integration of these narrative and visual components.

# User Research 

## Target Audience
The primary audience for this project is Heinz College leadership, addressed in a direct yet conversational narrative style.  The project is equally intended to engage current Heinz students, particularly those who may not have previously considered arts integration as a relevant or urgent topic.

The goal is to build a centralized hub website that clearly articulates:

- The existing problem,
- Why arts integration matters for leadership development,
- A feasible pathway toward curricular and environmental change at Heinz.

Key Stakeholder Groups (Meso-Level)
- Program Directors
- Faculty and Curriculum Committees
- Dean’s Office

These individuals and groups hold decision-making influence and are well-positioned to champion innovations that frame the arts as an equity-driven leadership tool.

Action Item:
Meet with stakeholders to surface current pain points and discuss opportunities for arts integration.

Potential Strategies:
- Pilot small “Arts & Leadership” modules within core classes or orientation. Use student feedback to make the case for broader adoption.
- Re-examine core course syllabi with an eye toward integrating examples, case studies, or applied topics from the arts, humanities, and creative industries.

Systems Context Summary: Heinz College currently functions within a structure that prizes technical rigor, efficiency, and quantifiable outcomes. This environment often deprioritizes creativity, arts-based learning, and reflective practices. Policies, norms, and data flows reinforce this culture: data moves top-down, incentives reward technical excellence, and qualitative skills like empathy, imagination, and interdisciplinary thinking remain undervalued.

These dynamics create a reinforcing feedback loop that sustains a narrow, data-centric culture.  However, emerging balancing loops—DEI work, mental-health advocacy, and student-led arts initiatives—present opportunities to shift toward a more holistic leadership model.

Data Collection for Giorgia Lupi–Style Visualization
To create the analog-inspired visualization of arts-related coursework at Heinz, I developed a Google Form survey (link included in submission). Using program handouts, I listed all core and elective courses and asked Program Directors/Advisors to evaluate each course on the following impression-based indicators:
- Arts-related class
- Includes arts-based examples
- Taught by an “artist”
- Open to non-program students
- Enrolled in by students from other programs

The survey intentionally collects non-formal, perception-driven responses appropriate for artistic visualization rather than statistical analysis.

Since these responses are still incoming, most feedback gathered this week focuses on the narrative structure and Shorthand layout rather than the visualization itself.

## Interview 
Research Goals
- Finalize the structure and overall layout of the Shorthand template.
- Ensure the digital storytelling elements feel interactive and compelling.
- Strengthen the clarity of the argument and the emotional arc of the narrative.
- Establish a clear and realistic call to action for both leadership and students.

## Interview Findings
This week’s interviews were conducted in small groups during class to gather feedback on narrative structure and early layout choices. Data visualization interviews will be completed once survey responses are received.

Insights Across Interviews
- Strong Framing: The introduction and initial problem framing were well-received—beginning with a relatable hook, moving to a central question, broadening to national context, and narrowing down to the specific Heinz focus.
- Effective Template Choice: Interviewees agreed the chosen Shorthand template aligns well with the story and can effectively support the final visuals.
- Text Density: While the writing was described as clear and strong, participants noted it is long and may benefit from more skim-friendly design choices (e.g., strategic bolding, sub-headers, visual anchors).
- Story Strength: Feedback emphasized strengthening the “story” component—ensuring the visuals reinforce the emotional and intellectual argument rather than feeling supplemental.
More detailed visualization-specific findings will follow once survey data is available.

# Identified changes for Part III
Because the Giorgia Lupi–style visualization depends on pending survey data from Program Directors and Advisors, I will complete this section once I receive those responses. At that point, I will finalize the visualizations, conduct a second round of targeted interviews, and integrate the findings into the Shorthand site.

For now, this section is intentionally left empty until the full dataset is available.
