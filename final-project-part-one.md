# Final Project Outline
For my final project, I am exploring the missing role of arts education within Heinz College and using data to illuminate why creative learning is essential for training future leaders in policy, technology, and management.  While Heinz emphasizes analytics, systems thinking, and technical proficiency, national arts education data reveals how creativity, arts access, and human-centered learning directly correlate with improved leadership, community-building, and academic outcomes.

My story aims to bridge these two realities: (1) the national evidence showing arts education’s measurable benefits, and (2) the gap in exposure, curriculum integration, and cultural valuation within Heinz College.  Ultimately, the project will advocate (through narrative and visual evidence) for treating arts education not as enrichment, but as a leadership and equity imperative.

_**BEGINNING "THE EXPECTATION"**_:
Heinz College markets itself as a place where leaders learn to navigate people, policy, and technology.  Students expect a holistic curriculum that prepares them for complex human-centered problem solving.

_**MIDDLE “THE TENSION”**_:
Data from the Arts Education Data Project (across multiple states) shows a strong, quantifiable link between arts exposure and leadership characteristics such as creativity, empathy, community connection, academic engagement, and adaptability.  Yet, within Heinz’s core curriculum, arts-based learning is nearly absent. This gap creates an equity and learning imbalance.

_**END “THE RESOLUTION”**_:
By visualizing national arts education trends and mapping them onto Heinz’s curricular ecosystem, I aim to show that integrating arts-based methods is not optional- it is a measurable, data-supported driver of better leadership outcomes.  The project concludes with data-backed recommendations for integration.

# The Data
My primary data source will be the [Arts Education Data Project (AEDP)](https://artseddata.org/national_report_2019/), which compiles statewide arts education access, enrollment, participation, and program data across 31 states.  While public dashboards provide high-level summaries, the raw spreadsheet datasets are not directly downloadable; I have contacted the AEDP directly for access.  If full datasets are not provided, I will reconstruct a usable dataset by extracting reported values from multiple AEDP dashboards and published annual reports.

In addition to AEDP, I may supplement with:
- Americans for the Arts survey findings
- NCES school engagement metrics where relevant
- CEO/leadership data from IBM and Deloitte global leadership reports

I will use these datasets to quantify:
- Rates of arts access
- Correlations between arts exposure and leadership-related outcomes
- Differences between arts-rich and arts-poor learning environments

These metrics will contextualize the experiential gap at Heinz College by demonstrating what is gained when arts learning is present (and what is lost when it is absent).

| Name | URL | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
|Arts Education Data Project|https://artseddata.org|State-level data on arts access, participation, and program structures.  It will be used for national comparisons and correlations.|
|Americans for the Arts Research|https://www.americansforthearts.org|Leadership, civic engagement, and arts participation data. Supplements leadership + creativity components.|
|NCES / Additional Public Education Data|https://nces.ed.gov|Potential supplemental datasets for attendance, engagement, and academic outcomes.|

# Method & Medium
I plan to complete this project using a combination of:
- Tableau for interactive or polished visualizations
- Figma/Illustrator for storytelling layout and designed narrative elements
- Good Charts principles to build a cohesive visual arc aligned with emotional and analytical clarity

The final deliverable will be a data-driven story presented either as a long-form scrolling website or a polished multi-page report blending narrative, visuals, and recommendations.
