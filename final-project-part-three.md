# The Final Data Story

# Changes Made Since Part II
While the overall narrative remained the same, I significantly expanded and refined the data visualizations to strengthen the argument and improve clarity.  New visual elements include:

- Choropleth maps by artistic discipline (Music, Visual Arts, Theater, Dance, Media, Other)
- Arts Enrollment Rates showing the percentage of students enrolled in arts courses
- Call-out statistics
- Heinz Curriculum Breakdown, visualized through a customized, art-driven schema
- A gallery-style visualization of student artwork, displayed as overlays inspired by how artwork is installed in the Heinz College hallways

These visualizations emerged organically.  I often built one, then shared it with peers to gather feedback, prompting questions such as: What does this data suggest to you? and How do these two visualizations work together to support the story?  Their responses directly shaped the final structure and sequencing of the visuals.

## The Audience
The project is designed for two main audiences:

- Fellow Heinz students, to build awareness and spark curiosity about arts engagement
- Heinz leadership, who have the positional authority to integrate arts-based learning into the curriculum meaningfully

Insights from informal interviews helped me understand what information would resonate with each group.  As a result, I centered the narrative on creativity, leadership development, and the student experience, and adjusted the data story to appeal to both students’ lived experiences and administrators’ strategic priorities.

## Final Design Decisions
A major design focus was the artistic representation of the Heinz curriculum, inspired by Giorgia Lupi’s work in data humanism.  My goal was to create visuals that were not only informative but also aesthetically compelling—data that felt like art.

The process included:
- Collecting curricular information through a form sent to Program Directors (with gaps filled using program handbooks when responses were limited)
- Establishing a visual vocabulary-- what each tally, icon, or symbol represented
- Selecting a color palette aligned with the existing Shorthand theme to maintain a polished, cohesive look

One area for future iteration, based on feedback, is how I represent courses “taught by an artist.”  Currently marked with scattered white dots, this approach resonated aesthetically but confused some viewers.  Expressing this instead as a percentage or proportional slice may improve clarity.

This raises a larger question I continue to think about:  Where is the boundary between artistic expression and clear data visualization?  As someone drawn to a more artistic, freeform approach, I enjoy the look of the scattered dots—but clarity may need to take precedence in future versions.

# Final Thoughts
I want to reiterate a key reflection I’ve shared previously: while I deeply enjoyed learning new tools and constructing an argument through data, I’m increasingly convinced that this course is also an incredible opportunity to meaningfully integrate arts-based learning into the Heinz curriculum itself.

The process of drafting repeated reflections—while helpful—used time I wish could have been devoted to sketching, iterating, mood-boarding, and imagining new visual forms beyond the capabilities of standard tools.  I’m intrigued by a future version of this course where students keep a sketchbook, spend less time in Canvas, and more time exploring data visualization as both analysis and artistic exploration.

This project affirmed my belief that creativity and data are not separate domains-- and that arts engagement has a powerful role to play in shaping future leaders.
